# Docs on my learning experience

- The first changes on the app

The code firstly was written with the library pySmartDL, but then I thought about it and it made sense to rebuild the app with the requests lib because of the good documentation and the resources to learn
more. I started to struggle with the requests lib, so with the help of chatGPT writing and explaining the code modified in the download func I started to understand more, now I want to add a pause and
resume func with only little hints and explaining from chatGPT to enlarge my knowledge in python and out of the box mentality.
